        "Arrow fade out no scroll" typically refers to a user interface feature 
        where arrow indicators (often used for navigation) gradually disappear or 
        become less visible when there is no scrolling activity. This effect is used 
        to create a cleaner and less distracting visual environment when the user is
         not actively scrolling. When scrolling resumes, the arrows fade back in to
          indicate that additional content is available in that direction. 
          This technique enhances user experience by maintaining visual cues 
          without constant clutter on the screen.
